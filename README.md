CDR-8 - An implementation of Generic Equality and Comparison for Common Lisp

This library is a portable implementation of [CDR 8][1].

In short, this provides hooks for user-defined equality (`EQUALS`) and
comparison (`COMPARE`) in addition to the expected defaults to the standard
equality operators of Common Lisp.
